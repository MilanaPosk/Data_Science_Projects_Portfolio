# Data_Science_Projects_Portfolio
This repository contains the projects related to data collecting, assessing, cleaning, visualizations, analyzing and ML. This repository is mainly for projects I have done in Yandex.Practicum course.

With each project in my portfolio, I strengthen my skills with Python (numpy, pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib , seaborn), ML and SQL as.
